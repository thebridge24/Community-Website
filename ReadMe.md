This is a community Website design project given me from my boss, this is realy cool I am asked to recreate the one I saw in the sample page. 
So I neeed to deliver completely.
Right now what I have to do is to firstly create the Html, CSS, & JS files.
After the website has been completely styled, then we wil need to make the animations and keyframes.
Then we will move to making the photo slider work correctly 
Then the comment sesiion has to work too.
After that i am done with the website home page project.
